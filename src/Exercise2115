Expensive exchange. A clerk at a shipping company is charged with the task of
rearranging a number of large crates in order of the time they are to be shipped out.
Thus, the cost of compares is very low (just look at the labels) relative to the cost of ex-
changes (move the crates). The warehouse is nearly fullâ€”there is extra space sufficient
to hold any one of the crates, but not two. What sorting method should the clerk use?
