2.1.8 Suppose that we use insertion sort on a randomly ordered array where elements
have only one of three values. Is the running time linear, quadratic, or something in
between?

The runtime of Insertion sort is highly dependent on whether or not the array is partially sorted.
We have 3 values on an N randomly ordered array. It's hard to say if this will have any effect
on the runtime. But if it's randomly shuffled it won't matter, the runtime will still be
quadratic.
